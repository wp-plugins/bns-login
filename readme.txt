== Description ==

A simple plugin providing a link to the dashboard; and, a method to log in and out of your blog in the footer of the theme. This is ideal for those not wanting to use the meta widget/code links.

2. Upload the contents of the `bns-login` folder (from above) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it really that simple? =

Yes, it really is.

= Can the plugin be styled? =

Yes, the plugin text is wrapped in its own `<div id="bns-logged-in" class="bns-login">` or `<div id="bns-logged-out" class="bns-login">` depending on the login status of the user. Just add your preferred specific properties to the active theme's style.css file; or, edit the included `bns-login-style.css` file which contains a framework of the CSS elements generated by the plugin.

== Screenshots ==
1. Logged in text.
2. Logged out text.
